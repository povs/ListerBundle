### [Documentation]()

Lister bundle helps to simplify and standardize data listing with pagination, filtering, sorting and more.

It compacts all list information into a single class which is easy to understand, extend and use.
 
By default library ships with two list types:
 - ArrayListType - can return data as array or json (paginated or not)
 - CsvListType - returns data as string separated by delimiter via streamed response.
 
However it is very easy to build your own list type for various needs.
 
For full stack web applications with `twig` consider using [ListerTwigBundle](https://github.com/povs/ListerTwigBundle)
which provides twig and ajax list types with various themes which can be modified.
